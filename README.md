The goal is to statistically analyze and predict the usage of an app. 

Hypothesis testing: Typical AB testing. Do some exploratory analysis and statistically validate if the number of clicks is different in two groups.

Polynomial regression: Predict the number of clicks based on the loading time of the app

Time series: Predict the number of clicks in the future based on the past number of clicks
